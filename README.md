# RxJS Wall

* My first attempt at reactive functional programming, based on [Manuel Wieser's RxJS Breakout](https://manu.ninja/functional-reactive-game-programming-rxjs-breakout).
* Adapts Manuel Wieser's game so that it could possibly make revising 汉字 more interesting for young learners.
* To experiment with/further develop this game, do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/VaughanJackson/rxjs-wall.git
cd rxjs-wall
npm install
npm start
```
